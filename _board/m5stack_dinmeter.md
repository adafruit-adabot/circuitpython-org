Din Meter is a 1/32 DIN standard embedded development board equipped with a 1.14-inch ST7789 screen and powered by an M5StampS3 as its main controller. It features a built-in rotary encoder for precise knob position tracking. Additionally, it includes an RTC circuit, an onboard buzzer, and buttons below the screen for device interaction and alert notifications. In terms of power supply, the design supports a wide voltage input range of 6-36V DC and has reserved interfaces for a lithium battery and charging circuit to cater to various needs. Moreover, reserved PORTA and PORTB interfaces facilitate the expansion of I2C and GPIO devices. This product is suitable for applications in parameter measurement and detection, smart home control, Internet of Things (IoT) projects, smart wearables, access control, industrial control, and educational maker projects.
